## React Hooks and Routing

- **React Hooks:**
  - Utilized useState() for powerful state variables in React.
  - Implemented useEffect() for managing side effects in functional components.

- **Routing:**
  - Implemented client-side routing for a seamless and dynamic user experience.
  - Explored both client-side and server-side routing techniques.

## Redux Toolkit

- Installed `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux`.
- Built a Redux store and seamlessly connected it to the application.
- Utilized slices, dispatching actions, and selectors, with a focus on cartSlice.

## Testing

- Types of Testing:
  - Unit Testing
  - Integration Testing
  - End-to-End Testing (e2e testing)

- Testing Setup:
  - Installed React Testing Library and Jest.
  - Configured Babel for JSX compatibility in test cases.
  - Leveraged Jest for unit testing and jsdom for DOM testing.

## Project Setup

- **Installation:**
  - `npm install` - Install project dependencies.
  - `npm start` - Start the development server.

- **Export/Import:**
  - Default Export/Import: `export default Component; import Component from "path";`
  - Named Export/Import: `export const Component; import {Component} from "path";`
